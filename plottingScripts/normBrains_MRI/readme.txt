The "colin27" brain templete was downloaded from: http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/ServicesAtlases/Colin27Highres
Then, it was segmented in SPM12 & normalized (voxel size = 1 mm) to the SPM's brain template to ensure the same processing as with the subject specific brains.

The ICBM was downloaded from: https://github.com/neurodebian/spm12/blob/master/toolbox/DARTEL/icbm152.nii
Then, it was coregistered & normalized (voxel size = 1 mm) to the SPM's brain template (TPM.nii) to ensure the same processing as with the subject specific brains.
